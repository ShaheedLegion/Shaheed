	<h1>Who is Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<h2>Meet the Christian</h2>
	<p>
	Shaheed is a newly practising Christian who found God, thankfully, under normal circumstances.

	<p class="quote">
	My parents were devout Christians all through my childhood, and I used to be involved in the church. I kind of drifted away from God in my teens, but found him before I found marriage. He was always with me, performing miracles, great and small, I just needed to open my eyes and start thanking Him for putting me where I am today.

<h3>The early years</h3>
<p>Shaheed was born into an Islamic family. At the tender age of 3, his family was ostracised because his mother had found Christianity. A year later his father converted too - they all kept their names, much to confusion of all they meet.</p>

<p>Shaheed was always involved in the church, at first he was a choral singer, later progressing to a musician in the church band. His spiritual life took a nosedive when he busied himself with athletics and acting activities, which consumed most of his time. His teens were filled with turmoil, but he always had a guardian angel watching over him.</p>

<p>He found his spiritual side again in late 2012 when he and his soon-to-be-wife converted during a church ceremony at the Christ Our King church. The church was graceful enough to grant them a free wedding, with members of the congregation providing everything they would need to tie the knot.</p>
