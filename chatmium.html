	<h1>Chat to Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<h2>Welcome from Chatmium</h2>
	<p>
	Shaheed has made tackled quite a few projects over the years, and none of them were as much fun as Chatmium - a Chrome Web Store chat widget that runs in the browser. Chatmium is a sophisticated Ajax-powered chat widget, with an emphasis on an open community, and as such does not contain "rooms" or "private messages", which only serves to segregate the chat community.
	</p>
	<p><b>Chatmium is a <u>free download!</u></b></p>
	<p>
	If you head over to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatmium-chat-to-friends/boooppebmgbdpeilgjcablcoephkhedd?hl=en">Chatmium page on the Chrome Web Store</a> you will be able to download the widget and chat to people from all over the world. So, please spread the word, we could do with a few more friends.

<h3>Technical details</h3>	
	<p>
	Well, for all the programmers and web-devs out there, I can share some of the technical details with you:
	<ul>
	<li>The Chatmium front-end uses HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript</li>
	<li>The Chatmium back-end is hosted right here on this site, and is written using PHP4.4 syntax (although it's running on a PHP5 interpreter)</li>
	<li>In total, Chatmium is less than 1000 lines of code, that's front end + back end.</li>
	<li>Chatmium uses emoticons by Bruno Maia (<a href="http://icontexto.deviantart.com/">IconTexto on DeviantArt</a>)</li>
	<li>Chatmium is Open-Source and the source package will be available either here, or on GitHub very soon, so check back in a few days.</li>
	<li>Chatmium is an ongoing project, which was originally coded in a single night, since then there have been numerous improvements to the UI and UX. Safety is also a concern, so the back-end has gotten a revamp.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	If you want to contribute, send an email to Shaheed[at]ShaheedAbdol[dot]co[dot]za with the word "Chatmium" somewhere in the subject line and I'll get back to you with planned features and source code.
