	<h1>Who is Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<h2>Meet the web developer</h2>
	<p>
	Shaheed has worked on quote a few websites in his short time on this earth. He has operated his own blog, powered by WordPress, which he soon became bored of. Shaheed later went on to design several fully functional website, which are still around, see them below:

<h3>2004-2013</h3>
<p>Well, this website is one of them. This website was hand-coded using HTML5 and CSS3, with some Javascript thrown into the mix. Here and there I've used jQuery to simplify things a bit.</p>

<p>He also designed the <a class="bl" href="http://www.tracedigital.co.za">Trace Digital Services</a> website.</p>

<p>Shaheed also created the <a class="bl" href="http://www.paulandrew.co.za">Paul Andrew</a> website while working at Trace Digital Services.<p>

<p>There's also the <a class="bl" href="http://webdesigncapetown.zzl.org">Web Design Cape Town</a> website, coded in much the same way, but not using jQuery.</p>

<p>An earlier project is the <a class="bl" href="http://www.chrstourking.org.za">Christ Our King</a> website, which is still in development.</p>

<p>You could also check out his personal blog over at <a class="bl" href="http://www.codingsucksiloveit.blogspot.com">Coding Sucks I Love It!</a> where he rants and raves about what it's like to code... You will find links to his Google+ profile there, and links to his CodeProject and StackOverflow profiles on his Google+ page.</p>
