	<h1>Who is Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<h2>Meet the web developer</h2>
	<p>

	<h2>The journey continues ...</h2>

<h3>2004-2013</h3>
<p>Well, this website is one of them. This website was hand-coded using HTML5 and CSS3, with some Javascript thrown into the mix. Here and there I've used jQuery to simplify things a bit.</p>

<p>He also designed the <a class="bl" href="http://www.tracedigital.co.za">Trace Digital Services</a> website.</p>

<p>Shaheed also created the <a class="bl" href="http://www.paulandrew.co.za">Paul Andrew</a> website while working at Trace Digital Services.<p>

<p>There's also the <a class="bl" href="http://webdesigncapetown.zzl.org">Inspirational Designs</a> website, coded in much the same way, but not using jQuery.</p>

<p>You can check out some of his travels at the <a class="bl" href="http://inspirationaltravels.co.nr/">Inspirational Travels</a> which documents some of his travels with his wife.</p>

<p>An earlier project is the <a class="bl" href="http://www.chrstourking.org.za">Christ Our King</a> website, which is still in development.</p>

<p>You could also check out his personal blog over at <a class="bl" href="http://www.codingsucksiloveit.blogspot.com">Coding Sucks I Love It!</a> where he rants and raves about what it's like to code... You will find links to his Google+ profile there, and links to his CodeProject and StackOverflow profiles on his Google+ page.</p>
