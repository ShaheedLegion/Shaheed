	<h1>Who is Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<h2>Meet the Traceur</h2>
	<p>
	Shaheed is currently a Parkour Tracuer, one who uses the urban environment as their own obstacle course, he started discovering the sport way back on 2004 and has never regretted it.

	I remember the first time I discovered Parkour, it was entirely by accident - I was chasing cats across the <i>Rooi plein</i> and a buddy of mine told me that it looked similar to a video he'd seen on Youtube, he later showed me a video of David Belle doing a short Parkour run, and I've been hooked ever since.

<h3>2004-2013</h3>
<p>Shaheed has since stopped practising Parkour, but will soon get back into the diving and rolling when his life isn't so busy anymore, we've included a bunch of pics to keep you happy.</p>
