<h2>The drama on two wheels...</h2>
	<h3>The early years</h3>
	<p class="quote">
	I have always known that I would end up being a biker ... I think I knew even before I understood what it meant...
	</p>

	<p>
	Shaheed spent his childhood fascinated by bicycles, motorcycles, rollerblades and pretty much any other vehicle. He became nearly obsessed with bicycles when his parents bought him his first "real" bicycle, a 26" mountain bike, which gave him endless joy. The real fun started with his parents got him a mountain bike with shock absorbers, which is what prompted Shaheed to tackle the long roads. From the first day he got his bicycle Shaheed wanted to go farther, and faster than others around him. He regularly cycled up Table Mountain, around the peninsula to Kommetjie, past the strawberry farms and all the way down to Hout Bay.
	</p>
	
	<p class="quote">
	I loved the feeling of freedom, being able to use my legs to take me wherever I wanted to go - faster than walking, less tiring than running ... I was fascinated by seeing how far I could go ... regularly taking full-day excursions hundreds of kilometers from home using only my bicycle, and sheer willpower to get me there, it was what defined my determination.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Then disaster struck. Shaheed was hit by a drunk driver, both his legs were fractured, and his bicycle was history. Shaheed, along with witnesses, were able to get the license plate information from the reckless vehicle before the driver sped off. The next couple of months would be a trying time as Shaheed struggled to cope with the restrictions of a wheelchair. Willpower, and the ability to ignore pain kept him going, eventually earning him a pair of crutches and some much-needed mobility.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	By the end of the year, Shaheed was fully recovered, and discarded his crutches. He was free again. Instead of trying his hand at cycling, Shaheed became an athlete. Succeeding at long distance running, Shaheed quickly became a star athlete, both at high school, and after school. Running for Club Midas, participating in the Engen Open Series, and various school championships.
	</p>

	<h3>2007 - 2013</h3>
	<p>
	After landing his first "big" programming job, Shaheed was more equipped to pursue his dream of becoming a biker, he saved up his money, bit the bullet and bought his first motorcycle. A Moto Mia Mocca 125cc motorcycle.
	</p>

	<p class="quote">
		I will never forget my first bike, we named her Lucille after a guitar in some anime. My buddy sold me his bike at a huge discount. He spent about five minutes, in total, teaching me how to drive the bike - then he gave me a lift home and left Lucille with me. The following morning I drove Lucille to work - 23Km away, in heavy traffic and no motorcycle experience...
		I got to work without incident, going home was just as easy. That's how much I loved biking.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After spending 2 years with Lucille, Shaheed decided to "upgrade", but was fearful of taking a motorcycle which would be too large. He opted to purchase a Loncin - LX200-2 200cc motorcycle, and kept himself occupied for the years following by learning the intricacies of the slightly larger, and faster, machine.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After much deliberation, and saving, Shaheed finally took the big plunge in 2012, and bought himself a 600cc Suzuki RF600R superbike. The bike, who would later be named Suzie, was a best of a machine, and Shaheed spent all his free time riding - trying to learn to do the delicate dance that is biking.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Shaheed soon mastered the intricacies of riding a Superbike, and became very adept at taking long distance drives in a fraction of the time it would take using other vehicles. He and his wife have been all over with Suzie, Piketberg, Aurora, Kommetjie, Chapman's Peak, Langebaan and Melkbosstrand to name but a few places they have travelled.
	</p>
	<p>
	Then in early 2013 disaster struck, Shaheed and his wife were involved in a collision with another motorcycle. The other rider was drunk and swerved in front of them. Suzie was fine, but the other bike was totalled. Later that same day an unscrupulous driver would, once again, drive into Suzi. This time the driver was looking to have a quick accident so he could extort money to fix his, already broken car. Luckily, with many prayers and much correspondence, the insurance brokers finally managed to conclude the investigations and determined that Shaheed would be compensated for his troubles, and that the other drivers would get the cold shoulder with regards to payment for their misdeeds.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Today Shaheed, Fatima and Suzie regularly enjoy long drives, and are planning a trip down to Hermanus as soon as the weather permits.
