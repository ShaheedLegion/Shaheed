	<h1>Play Space Defenders!</h1>
	<h2>Written by Shaheed Abdol</h2>
	<p>
	Space defenders is a 2D top-down shooter, written entirely in JavaScript, using no libraries. Graphics and sounds are sourced from all over the internet. Space Defenders is very much a work in progress and will likely be in development for another couple of weeks. Try your hand at the demo over here <a class="bl" href="http://www.ShaheedAbdol.co.za/spacedefense/">Space Defenders!</a>

<h3>Compatibiltiy</h3>	
<p>Shaheed is currently working on improving the experience for mobile users, but currently this is best run on a PC. Space Defenders clocks in at around 60FPS running the latest Chrome on 64bit and 32bit Windows. Internet Explorer does decently as well, Firefox comes in dead last with the poorest performance of all the browsers we tested. Even Chrome on my Acer tablet does better than Firefox does on a Deskop PC with great specs. It seems that FireFox has a long way to go before they catch up to the speed which Chrome offers.</p>
