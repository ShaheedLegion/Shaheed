	<h1>Who is Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<p>
	Shaheed Abdol is just another guy, born in 1986, who wanted to make something better of his life... He studied hard, played hard, worked hard and spends each day striving to outperform himself.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The early years...</h2>
	<hr/>
	<h3>1986</h3>
	<p>
	Shaheed Abdol was born on the 26th January 1986, a healthy baby boy. He developed into a highly intelligent child, who mastered reading by the age of 5, and always stayed at an advanced reading level. He was a voracious reader, and quickly discovered his love for the sciences.
	</p>
	
	<h3>The "tween" years</h3>
	</p>
	Primary School progressed normally, although his parents were offered the option to advance Shaheed's grade, twice, due to his advanced reading ability and quick comprehension. His parents turned down the offers, thinking about his psychological development, and wanting him to progress at a natural pace.

	<h3>2001</h3>
	<p class="quote">
	"At the time I had no formal background in coding, when I started I didn't even own a computer - relying on printouts my friends so that I could study the code and make the best of my time I could borrow with the school computers."
	</p>

	<p class="quote">
	"Having quickly excelled, I mastered Java within a few months, going from Turtle, to AWT, to Applets I grew tired of the language and the limitations it imposed on developers, such as the SandBox model."
