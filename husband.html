	<h1>Who is Shaheed Abdol?</h1>
	<h2>Meet the husband</h2>

	<h2>The love story...</h2>

	<h3>2007</h3>
	<p class="quote">
	I will never forget the day I laid eyes on her... mid 2007, she was much younger than me, but I simply couldn't help myself, I've loved her for as long as I've known her...
	</p>

	<p>
	Shaheed met his wife through mutual friends, he liked her, but she was much younger than he was ... so he kept his feelings hidden. She was shy and introverted, but secretly like him too, it seemed like it would never happen. But, slowly, as the years passed, they became closer friends, more bold and confident in each other, until one day Fatima declared her love for Shaheed. The pair were dating soon after, and life was good.

	She was always the quiet one, it took quite a bit of coaxing on my part t get her to speak to me, but I relished the day we finally had our first, awkward, conversation.

	<h3>2012 - 2013</h3>
	<p>It wasn't always plain sailing, the couple had their fair share of heartache, close calls and misunderstandings. But after a long courtship which built their rock-solid relationship, the couple were finally married in January of 2013.</p>
	
	<p class="quote">
	Even if I grow old and see the stars fade away, I will never forget how beautiful she looked that day, in her wedding dress ... while I waited for her at the altar..."
